# SparkML_Decision-Trees_Random-Forest-Model

Business Problem
-----------------

predict whether university based feautures is private or public

Solution:
----------

Model has been built using 3 tree based models(Decision trees, GBT Tress, RandomForest classifiers).Evaluating the classificaion model using BinaryClassificationEvaluator. Also, Model has achieved fairly good results for Random Forest. 

In order to evaluate accuracy, f1 score etc., for 3 models MulticlassclassificationEvaluator is used to check out the results. see the documentation: (spark.apache.org) to experiment on other metrics.
